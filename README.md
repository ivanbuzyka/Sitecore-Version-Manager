Sitecore-Version-Manager
========================

The Version Manager module allows you to specify how many versions an item is allowed to have before making the oldest version obsolete by either deleting them through the application or set it up automatically.
Version Manager allows users to keep only required amount of content item versions and archive obsolete ones.
